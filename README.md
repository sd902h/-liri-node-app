# -liri-node-app

Hello, welcome to LIRI bot.

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Go on and give it a try by testing what songs, concerts, or movies are in town.
